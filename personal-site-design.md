What is you site's primary purpose?
My site's current purpose is to help me develop my web devolpment skills and record my personal development. Later this will change instead to displaying my web development skills to prospective employers.

Who is your target audience?
Currently there is no target audience, it is purely a tool for myself. Later on, I would hope it is useful for me as a portfolio and so the target audience would be clients or employers.

How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?
I would like site visitors to be impressed with the layout and accessibility of the website. It should be easy for them to navigate anywhere they would like to. Simple buttons with hover tooltips and ease of reading are important.

How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?
I will continuously update my website, improving it over many iterations as my skill in web development increases. I would like to have some very simple HTML structure and tags and then primarily use CSS and Javascript to populate and present the website.
